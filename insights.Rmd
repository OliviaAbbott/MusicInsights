Tidyverse handles data importing and wrangling:

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
library("tidyverse")
```

When importing data use relative paths instead of absolute paths. Use paths reletive to the directory this file is in.

```{r}
survey <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/music-survey.csv")
preferences <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/introdsci/MusicSurvey/master/preferences-survey.csv")

nrow(survey)
nrow(preferences)
```

Cleaning data column names:

```{r}
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "First, we are going to create a pseudonym for you to keep this survey anonymous (more or less). Which pseudonym generator would you prefer?"] <- "generator_name"
colnames(survey)[colnames(survey) == "What is your pseudonym?"] <- "pseudonym"
```
